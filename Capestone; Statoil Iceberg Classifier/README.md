# San Fransisco Crime Classification Problem
## Capstone Project

## Problem Statement:
Drifting icebergs present threats to navigation and activities in areas such as offshore of the East Coast of Canada. Currently, many institutions and companies use aerial reconnaissance and shore-based support to monitor environmental conditions and assess risks from icebergs. However, in remote areas with particularly harsh weather, these methods are not feasible, and the only viable monitoring option is via satellite.  

So, we are challenged to build an algorithm that automatically identifies if a remotely sensed target is a ship or iceberg from satellite imagery. Improvements made will help drive the costs down for maintaining safe working conditions

## Data:

It's highly encouraged to work on kaggle website by creating a new kernel and uploading this notebook. In addition to Kaggle dataset, a saved model weights file was used; it's saved in the folder "statoil model weights", so, the working directory looks like the following:

You can find the weights file attatched.
