These are project for Udacity's Machine Learning Specialization Nanodegree program. 

## Supervised Learnig
- **titanic_survival_exploration**: Predicting the survival of a Titanic passenger based on the RMS Titanic passenger manifest.

- **boston_housing**: Predicting selling prices for Boston Housing based on data collected from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts.

- **finding_donors**: Applying supervised learning techniques on data collected from the U.S. census to predict possible donors to help CharityML (a fictitious organization).

## Unupervised Learnig
- **customer_segments**:
  - Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts of diverse product categories.
  - Describing the variations in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with.
  - Applying the appropriate features scaling, transformations and applying Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering algorithm to identify the various customer segments hidden in the data.

## Reinforcment Learnig
- **smartcab**:
  - Constructing an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that navigates a smart cab through its simulated environment towards its destination.
  - The driving agent is evaluated on two metrics: Safety and Reliability.
  - The result: Agent committed no traffic violations, and always chose the correct action. And it reached the destination on time for at least 90% of trips, rendering it safe and reliable

## Deep Learnig
- **dog_breed**:
