## Unsupervised Learnig
- **customer_segments**:
  - Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts of diverse product categories.
  - Describing the variations in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with.
  - Applying the appropriate features scaling, transformations and applying Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering algorithm to identify the various customer segments hidden in the data.

## Reinforcment Learnig
- **smartcab**:
  - Constructing an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that navigates a smart cab through its simulated environment towards its destination.
  - The driving agent is evaluated on two metrics: Safety and Reliability.
  - The result: Agent committed no traffic violations, and always chose the correct action. And it reached the destination on time for at least 90% of trips, rendering it safe and reliable

## Deep Learnig
- **dog_breed**: 
  - Using OpenCV's implementation of Haar feature-based cascade classifiers to detect human faces in images.  
  -> Sensitivity: ~100%
  - Using a pre-trained ResNet-50 model to detect dogs in images.  
  -> Sensitivity: ~100%
  - Creating a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds ( from scratch)
  - Creating a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds ( Using transfer learning: VGG19, InceptionV3)
  - Final Dog Breeds classifier -> accuracy: ~ 72%
  - Final Algorithm:
    - if a dog is detected in the image, the predicted breed is returned.
    - if a human is detected in the image, the resembling dog breed is returned.
    - if neither is detected in the image, output indicates an error.
